# UE4 Project
 
 Attempting to get a photorealistic AAA First Person horror exploration game, driven almost entirely by c++.
 Some blueprints are acceptable, but only for functions that would otherwise be obnoxious to continuously update in code.
 It wont be very long (or in depth) as this is really only a educational opportunity, but I hope to have a finished product with ~10-12 min of gameplay time.
 A list of the following hopefuls for this project are below. 
 
 Environments
 - One Location
   - Indoor
   - Outdoor

Gameplay Features
- Player Interaction
  - Open/Close Doors
  - In-Game terminals
  - Throw Items
- Flashlight/Night Vision Camera
- Crouching behind things
- Hiding places
- Enemy AI
- NPC AI

Misc Features
- Fully Voiced Characters
  - Player Character
  - Enemy AI
  - NPC AI
- Full In-World Audio
  - Sound Effects
  - Background and Title Music
 
 Environments and gameplay will be taking inspiration from Alien: Isolation, Routine, the art of Vasiliy Poryagin, and StoneMason.
 
 Goals for this project, from a skills perspective, are:
 - Teach myself c++
 - Teach myself git
 - Implement 3D art skills I have learned in the past year
 - Excersie my narrative writing ability
 - Excersie voice acting and directing ability
 - Further develop small teams management through
   - Managing other actors
   - Managing sound designer and composer

There is a lot happening here, but I feel like the end product will be worth it.

wholesome
